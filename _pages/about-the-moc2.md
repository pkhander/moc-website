<p class="has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The Mass Open Cloud (MOC) is a new production public cloud being developed based on the model of an Open Cloud Exchange (OCX),  a model where many stakeholders, rather than just a single provider,  participate in implementing and operating the cloud.  Hosted at Boston  University and housed at the Hariri Institute for Computing, the project  is a unique collaborative effort between higher education, government,  non-profit entities and industry.</p>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">These goals are not independent, but reply on each other. Only a production cloud with a customer base and a revenue stream that covers its costs can grow to sufficient size to enable the issues of scale that will drive sufficient size to enable the issues of scale that will drive reaserch, new technologies and enable full exploration of the OCX model. New innovation in cloud depends on having real users, with real workloads and data sets. The OCX model empowers a broad community of companies and reaserchers to participate to expose their innovation and profit from use of their technology.</p>
