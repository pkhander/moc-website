<h2><strong>Overview</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-medium-font-size">The NSF “Open Cloud Testbed” (OCT) project will build and support a testbed for research and experimentation into new cloud platforms – the underlying software which provides cloud services to applications. Testbeds such as OCT are critical for enabling research into new cloud technologies – research that requires experiments which potentially change the operation of the cloud itself. </p>

<p class="has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The new testbed will:</p>

<ul><li>Combine proven software technologies from both the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.cloudlab.us/" target="_blank">CloudLab</a> and the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://massopen.cloud" target="_blank">Mass Open Cloud</a> projects</li><li>Combine a research cloud testbed with a production cloud, through OCT’s tight integration with MOC</li><li>Federate with CloudLab</li><li>Provide programmable hardware (FPGAs) capabilities not present in other facilities available to researchers today</li></ul>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center","fontSize":"medium"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center has-medium-font-size">The combination of a testbed and production cloud allows:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Larger scale compared to isolated testbeds</li><li>Reproducible experimentation based on realistic user behavior and applications</li><li>A model for transitioning successful research results to practice</li></ul>

<p class="has-medium-font-size">The programmable hardware will be a unique resource enabling investigation into hardware acceleration techniques, research not possible on testbeds available to cloud researchers today, and the community outreach portion of the project aims to identify, attract, and retain these researchers, and to educate them in the use of the facility. The testbed offers a unique sustainability model, by allowing additional compute resources to be dynamically moved from institutional uses into the testbed and back again, providing a path to growth beyond the initial testbed. This testbed will accelerate innovation in cloud technologies; technologies affecting almost all of computing today. In providing capabilities that today are only available to researchers within a few large commercial cloud providers, it will allow diverse communities to exploit these technologies, “democratizing” cloud computing research, and allowing increased collaboration between the research and open source communities. The community outreach activities of the project are targeted to researchers who explore complex distributed systems and cloud platforms, spanning a diverse range of backgrounds, institutions, and regions. Software tools will be developed to provide easy and efficient access by these researchers; tutorials, workshops, and webinars will offer training in the use of these tools and the testbed itself. The project will support educating the next generation of researchers in this field, and existing relationships with industrial partners of the MOC will accelerate technology transfer from academic research to practical use. </p>
