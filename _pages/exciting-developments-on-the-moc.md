<p class="has-medium-font-size"><strong>Production Cloud:</strong> Due to the success of the MOC, Boston  University and Harvard University have decided to move forward to  create a production cloud service, the New England Research Cloud  (NERC),  supported by the professional Research IT staff from those  universities.  The vision of the NERC is to build a cohesive,  sustainable partnership between research clusters and technology  professionals with a common cloud framework that is tailored for  data-driven discovery and available to many institutions in New  England.  This partnership will set NERC apart from today’s public  clouds and is critical to bridge the gap in skills that are needed for  research and teaching professionals.  ..<a href="https://massopen.cloud/exciting-developments-on-the-moc-fall-2019-update/">.Read more</a></p>
