			<h2>About the MOC</h2>		
		<p>The Mass Open Cloud (MOC) is a new production public cloud being developed based on the model of an Open Cloud Exchange (OCX), a model where many stakeholders, rather than just a single provider, participate in implementing and operating the cloud. Hosted at Boston University and housed at the Hariri Institute for Computing, the project is a unique collaborative effort between higher education, government, non-profit entities and industry.</p>		
				<h3>
					Who is it for?
				</h3>
								<p>The course is aimed at anyone who wants to create websites on their own, and possibly work as a freelancer or employee in the field of web design and development. We cover everything, so even if you've never seen HTML code in your life, you'll be able to quickly jump in.</p>
